Do you believe in the power of groups to make informed decisions? Then help us bring Ukuvota to life.

Our mission is to revolutionize the way groups make decisions through score voting. With Ukuvota, we can ensure that every voice is heard and every proposal is given equal consideration.

But we need your help to make this a reality. Every dollar you donate will go towards covering the costs of development, marketing, and other expenses necessary to bring Ukuvota to life.
