Ukuvota: Borrowed from the Zulu word for 'to vote', our web application streamlines the voting process.

It unfolds in two phases:

- Collection: Anyone can submit solution proposals to a given topic. We aim to pool a diverse set of ideas.
- Voting: Proposals are then voted on using emojis from -3 (strongly against) to +3 (strongly in favor). A selectable negative weight factor can adjust the impact of downvotes, ensuring flexibility for your unique needs.

Kick off by setting up a process, defining the topic, and choosing phase durations. Collaborate, propose, and vote to converge on the best solutions.
